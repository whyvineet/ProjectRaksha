# Project Raksha - Women's Safety Mobile Application (Concept)

## Overview

**Project Raksha** is a conceptual mobile application designed to enhance women's safety in various environments. This README outlines the proposed features and considerations for potential future development.

## Proposed Features

### 1. Voice-Activated SOS
- **Secret Code Activation:** Users would trigger an SOS alert by speaking a pre-set secret code.
- **Emergency Alerts:** The app would send an SOS message, current location, and live location to pre-selected contacts and the nearest police station.
- **Live Tracking:** Live location sharing would remain active until contacts mark the user as safe.

### 2. Safest Path Navigation
- **Point-Based System:** Routes would be evaluated based on safety landmarks:
  - Police Station: +10 points
  - Mid-Traffic Area: +8 points
  - Well-Lit Streets: +7 points
- **Shortest Route Selection:** The app would aim to select the route with the highest safety score while being the shortest available.

### 3. Real-Time Safety Updates
- **User Reports:** Users could report unsafe areas to factor into safety scoring.
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** Safety scores would adjust in real-time based on incidents, time of day, and other factors.

### 4. Community Alerts
- **Proximity Notifications:** Users in the vicinity would be alerted if someone nearby triggers an SOS.
- **Emergency Numbers:** The app would be pre-loaded with emergency contact numbers, customizable by users.

## Development Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- **Voice Recognition:** Training for various accents and dialects, especially for diverse regions.
- **Background Operation:** Enabling the app to run in the background without excessive battery drain.
- **Data Sources:** Integrating reliable data for safety scoring from official and community sources.
- **Battery Optimization:** Ensuring efficient use of GPS and background processes.
- **Scalability:** Designing for large volumes of users, especially during peak usage.

### Privacy and Security
- **Data Encryption:** Implementing end-to-end encryption for all communications.
- **Accidental Triggers:** Developing safeguards against unintended SOS activations.
- **User Data Protection:** Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

### Partnerships and Integration
- **Law Enforcement Collaboration:** Establishing partnerships for efficient emergency response.
- **Mapping Services:** Potential integration with existing mapping platforms.

### Additional Features
- **Educational Resources:** Including information on self-defense, legal rights, and emergency procedures.
- **Customization:** Allowing users to personalize emergency contacts and alert settings.
